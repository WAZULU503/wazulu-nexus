# jdt (James Dev Tool)

Fast CLI tool for finding and killing blocked development ports.

When working on multiple local projects, ports like **3000**, **5173**, **8000**, or **8080** often remain open after a development server stops.

`jdt` quickly shows which process owns the port and which project started it, allowing you to terminate it instantly.

## Commands

### List active development ports
jdt p ls

PORT   SERVICE     PROJECT            PID  
3000   Next.js     storefront         4212  
5173   Vite        admin-dashboard    8421  
8000   Dev Server  api-server         1331  

---

### Kill a specific port
jdt p k 3000

You will be asked for confirmation before the process is terminated.

---

### Free all development ports
jdt p f

Lists active development ports and allows clearing them all at once.

---

### Show version
jdt version

## What jdt does

- Detects listening ports using `lsof`
- Maps ports to running processes
- Identifies the project directory that started the process
- Allows safe termination with confirmation

---

## Works on

- macOS
- Linux

---

## Example workflow

A development port is blocked:

Error: address already in use :3000

Run:

jdt p ls

Find the process:

PORT   SERVICE   PROJECT         PID  
3000   Next.js   marketing-site  4212  

Kill it:

jdt p k 3000

Port is now free.

Small tools that solve real developer problems.

- No frameworks  
- No telemetry  
- No background services  

Just a single fast Go binary.
